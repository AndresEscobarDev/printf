.B int _printf(const char *
.I format

.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf function is a variadic function that produces a string according to a
.I format
and prints to the standar output. This function was made for a
.B Holberton School
project and the expected is that the function works like the C standar library function printf.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon a successful return, the function returns the amount of characters printed. If an error is encountered then returns -1.
.SH Format of the format string
The format string contains any characters and it will be printed as it is. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a 
.I conversion specifier.
.SH THE CONVERSION SPECIFIER
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. Their meanings are:
.sp
.B d, i

.I int
into an 
.I unsigned char.
.sp
.B s
- Prints a string expected to be a pointer to an array of characters.
